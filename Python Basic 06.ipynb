    "1. What are escape characters, and how do you use them?\n",
    "Ans1- Escape characters are used to enter illegal strings using \\ followed by the string we want to enter. Example - \"My name is \\\"Ayesha\"\". So we can enter double quotes as a string without any error.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. The string \"Howl's Moving Castle\" is a correct value. Why isn't the single quote character in the word Howl's not escaped a problem?\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How do you write a string of newlines if you don't want to use the n character?\n",
    "Ans5- Generally we use \\n to move to newlines, but if we don't wish to use the n character then either we can use different print statements to get the output in new lines or we can use end = \"  \".\n",
